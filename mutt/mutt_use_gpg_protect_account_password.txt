How to setup gpg encryption:
(Source: https://gdtechdiaries.wordpress.com/2018/08/29/learn-how-to-install-and-configure-mutt/)

Are you worried that the password you just wrote in a muttrc file is a simple
text file anybody having knowledge about mutt and having access to your PC can
access that file and get your password?

 Don’t worry I have a solution for this.

  We are going to use “GNU Privacy Guard” (Also known as gpg) to encrypt the
  file containing your password.

   1. Create a password file-

   $ touch ~/.config/mutt/.password

   2. Open the file in any editor, for my case its VIM

   $ vi ~/.config/mutt/.password

   3. Make following changes-

   set imap_pass = 'your_password'
   set smtp_pass = 'your_password'

   Don’t forget to comment out these lines in the muttrc file.
   (Note- If you are unable to see your .password file by typing “$ ls”
   command then do type “$ ls -a” and you can now see that file. File starting
   with a dot is a hidden file. )

   4. Now create a public/private key pair:

   $ gpg --gen-key

   Do fill your real name & e-mail ID and carefully set the paraphrase and
   remember it because whenever you’ll open mutt, it will be asked to you.

   5. Encrypt .password file containing your password

   $ gpg -r myemail@email.com -e ~/.config/mutt/.password

   The -e flag tells GPG that you’ll be encrypting a file, and the -r flag
   specifies a recipient.

   6. Now remove the file named .password

   $ rm ~/.config/mutt/.password

   7. Now Add below lines in your mutt configuration files

   source “gpg -d ~/.config/mutt/.password.gpg |”

   8. And you are done.
