How to choose & insert signatures from a list of signatures
(Source: https://gdtechdiaries.wordpress.com/2018/08/29/learn-how-to-install-and-configure-mutt/)

I have usually seen my mentor (@hsrai) sending different signatures while
replying to a mail and I was amazed that how he did so because I am sure that
he is not going to always create a new signature, there must be an automated
script. Now I got the method (hope so ðŸ˜‰ )and I am also going to let you all
know, how you all can also do so.

 
 1. First of all you need to comment out the signature part from the .muttrc
 configuration file.

 2. Now add some more signatures into the signature file, all starting with a
 sigdash. (And also add something in that signature, that makes it different
 from others eg- LOST66 or Quote13)

 eg- My Signature File LINK(https://pastebin.com/embed_js/UyeNbvmh)

 (If you donâ€™t know what is Sigdash, follow this LINK HERE: http://www.guckes.net/mail/sig.etiquette.html)

 3. Now when you are in VIM typing a mail, Just go to the command line mode in
 VIM and run below command-

 read !agrep -d "^â€“ $" 'QUOTE 10' ~/.mutt/sig

 Use option "-d" which tells agrep that the next "word" is the pattern that
 describes the "delimiter".

 A '^' ("caret") denotes the start-of-line, and a '$' ("dollar") denotes the
 end-of-line. Therefore a line that contains only dash-dash-space is described
 with ^â€“ $.

 As you can see, agrep has now extracted the lines between two sigdashes lines
 which contains the word "QUOTE 10". Please note that the first delimiter
 (sigdashes) are also in the output.

 (I know this is not an automated script but yes it still reduces much of the
 human effort. I'll try more to automate it.)

 4. And you are done.
