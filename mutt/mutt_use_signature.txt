(Source: https://gdtechdiaries.wordpress.com/2018/08/29/learn-how-to-install-and-configure-mutt/)

1. Create a new file in the following directory, hit the command:

$ touch ~/.config/mutt/sig

2. Open sig file using any editor (For my case it’s VIM), and add your
signature in it.

$ vim ~/.config/mutt/sig

3. Append following lines in the muttrc configuration file:

set signature="~/.config/mutt/sig"

And you are done, whenever you’ll compose or reply a mail, this signature will
appear at bottom.
