Delete Text in Vim Insert Mode

While you can delete characters or several words at once in ex mode (i.e. dw to delete a word), you can also do so in Insert mode as follows:
    Ctrl + h: delete the previous character to the place where the cursor is currently located.
    Ctrl + w: delete the previous word to the place where the cursor is currently located.
              For this to work correctly, the cursor must be placed in an empty space after the word that you need to delete.
    Ctrl + u: delete the current line beginning at the character immediately to the left of the place where the cursor is.
