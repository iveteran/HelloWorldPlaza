It can be cumbersome to type in the login and password every time you connect
using OpenVPN. It has a feature named auth-user-pass where you can provide the
login and password in a file.

Put your login and password in a file, one on each line.

If you are using a OpenVPN config file to connect, indicate the above
file in it:

auth-user-pass /path/to/file

You can also provide this at the command by passing it to the
--auth-user-pass option.

Tried with: OpenVPN 2.3.7 and Ubuntu 15.10
