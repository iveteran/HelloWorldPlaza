How to Install GCC 7 on CentOS 7

Interested in keeping up with the latest C++ standard, I noticed that CentOS 7.4.1708 uses gcc version 4.8.5 20150623. This version of gcc defaults to ISO/IEC 14882:1998. Updated C++ standards have been released in 2003, 2011, 2014, and 2017. Although gcc developers are still implementing the 2017 standard, it is good to use a recent version of gcc that defaults to the 2014 standard. Installing centos-release-scl and devtoolset-7-gcc-c++ packages allows me to use a recent version of gcc.

To determine the default C++ standard used by g++:

1. $ g++ -dM -E -x c++ /dev/null | \
   grep -F __cplusplus

I did the following to install devtoolset-7:

1. # yum install centos-release-scl
2. # yum install devtoolset-7-gcc-c++

Every time I want gcc to default to using GCC 7, I run the following:

1. $ scl enable devtoolset-7 bash
