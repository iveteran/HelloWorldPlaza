Indeed, this can be achieved as it functions akin to a partition. I attempted the following approach, and it proved effective.

Make the original file, mount it, check, unmount it
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=test.file bs=1M count=102400 
$ mkfs.ext3 test.file 
$ mount test.file /mnt -o loop
$ df -h
$ umount /mnt

Grow it
$ dd if=/dev/zero count=102400 >> test.file
$ mount test.file /mnt -o loop
$ df -h
$ resize2fs /dev/loop0
$ df -h
Shrinking a file may work similarly, but it is invariably more challenging than expanding it. Of course, it must be done when the block device is not mounted.
