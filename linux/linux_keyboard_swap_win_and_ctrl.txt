If you're looking to swap the Ctrl + Cmd keys in Ubuntu 16.04 either just
because, or because you're using VirtualBox with an Ubuntu guest and an OSX
host, then the answer you're looking for is here. Courtesy of Joel Koh.

Instructions

1) Launch terminal
2) Edit X Keyboard Extension
   nano /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/pc

3) Make the following changes. Ensure your file looks like this:
   key <LCTL> {    [ Super_L       ]   };
   key <LWIN> {    [ Control_L     ]   };
   key <RCTL> {    [ Super_R       ]   };
   key <RWIN> {    [ Control_R     ]   };

4) Clear xkb's cache
   rm -rf /var/lib/xkb/*

(Conditional) If the keys are not swapped after step 4,
restart your computer. It worked for me after this.

Hope it helps, good luck!
