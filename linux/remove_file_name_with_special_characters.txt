Tip #1: Try a ./ at the beginning of the filename
The syntax is as follows to delete a file called ‘-file’:

$ rm -v ./-file
removed `./-file'
The ./ at the beginning of the filename forces rm not to interpret – as option to the rm command.

Tip #2: Try a -- at the beginning of the filename
A -- signals the end of options and disables further option processing by shell.
Any arguments after the -- are treated as filenames and arguments.
An argument of – is equivalent to –. The syntax is:

$ rm -v -- -file
$ rm -v -- --file
$ rm -v -- "@#$%^&file"
$ rmdir -v -- "--dirnameHere"

Tip #3: Remove file by an inode number
The -i option to ls displays the index number (inode) of each file:

ls -li
Use find command as follows to delete the file if the file has inode number 4063242:

$ find . -inum 4063242 -delete
OR
$ find . -inum 4063242 -exec rm -i {} ;
