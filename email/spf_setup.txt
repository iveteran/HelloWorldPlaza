Add DNS txt record:
txt	@	v=spf1 a mx ~all

Postfix does not typically check SPF records automatically, so this is something you need to manually configure – luckily it takes very few steps to do so on an Ubuntu server.
policyd-spf is a Phython-based service for checking SPF records. You will need to install it before you carry on to configure your Postfix server.

1. Install the policyd-spf package:
sudo apt install postfix-policyd-spf-python
(CentOS) sudo dnf install pypolicyd-spf
Note. There is also a perl package, postfix-policyd-spf-perl, if you prefer, but in this tutorial I will use the Python package.

2. Edit your master.cf file. E.g:
nano /etc/postfix/master.cf
Then add the following two lines at the bottom:

policyd-spf  unix  -       n       n       -       0       spawn
    user=policyd-spf argv=/usr/bin/policyd-spf

(CentOS)
policyd-spf  unix  -       n       n       -       0       spawn
    user=policyd-spf argv=/usr/libexec/postfix/policyd-spf

3. Edit the /etc/postfix/main.cf file.
You can go ahead and add policyd-spf_time_limit = 3600 – this option controls the timeout for policyd process.
This edit will depend on your existing configuration; your smtpd_recipient_restrictions needs to have check_policy_service added to it, so it will probably end up looking like this:

policyd-spf_time_limit = 3600
smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
  permit_sasl_authenticated,
  permit_mynetworks,
  reject_unauth_destination,
  check_policy_service unix:private/policyd-spf

4. Restart Postfix to make your changes go into effect.
systemctl restart postfix
You should now be done with the configuration.

Verify that your setup is working
You can verify that Postfix is checking SPF records correctly by examining your /var/log/mail.log file. E.g. grep is perfect for searching through log files:
OR sudo journalctl | grep 'Received-SPF'

grep -R "Received-SPF" /var/log/
This should result in something like:

May 19 11:32:17 ip-172-31-1-1 policyd-spf[113343]: prepend Received-SPF: Pass (mailfrom) identity=mailfrom; client-ip=x.x.x.x; helo=example.com; envelope-from=user@example.com; receiver=<UNKNOWN>
