# Overlay a transparent PNG on a video
ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -i overlay.png \
	-filter_complex "[0:v][1:v] overlay=0:0" \
	-c:a copy \
	output.mp4

-i video.mp4 is our source video
-i overlay.png is our PNG overlay
-filter_complex "[0:v][1:v] overlay=0:0"
• With [0:v][1:v] we are telling to FFMPEG put the input file with index 0 (the video) under the input file with index 1 (the overlay)
• With overlay=0:0 we are setting the position of our overlay (in this case, top-left corner as our video and overlay have the exact same width/height)
-c:a copy  → we want to re-use the audio from the source file
output.mp4  is the name of the output file
