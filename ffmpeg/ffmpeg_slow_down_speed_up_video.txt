# Slow Down Video with FFmpeg
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf "setpts=2.0*PTS" output.mp4

# Speed Up Video with FFmpeg
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf "setpts=0.5*PTS" output.mp4

NOTE:
SetPts will Re-encode your videos
Just as a cautionary note, when you use setpts in FFmpeg, it will drop frames to achieve the requested speed-up. And, this will force FFmpeg to re-encode your content. Always remember that you can set the video quality you need using CBR, Capped VBR, or CRF techniques while speeding up or slowing down your videos.
