--? ⊗	    No description ↪
--accept-empty-variations-seed-signature ⊗	Accept an empty signature when loading a variations seed. This is for testing purposes. ↪
--accept-lang ⊗	Specifies Accept-Language to send to servers and expose to JavaScript via the navigator.language DOM property. language[-country] where language is the 2 letter code from ISO-639. ↪
--accept-resource-provider ⊗	Flag indicating that a resource provider must be set up to provide cast receiver with resources. Apps cannot start until provided resources. This flag implies --alsa-check-close-timeout=0. ↪
--adaboost ⊗	No description ↪
--add-gpu-appcontainer-caps[1] ⊗	Add additional capabilities to the AppContainer sandbox on the GPU process. ↪
--add-xr-appcontainer-caps[1] ⊗	Add additional capabilities to the AppContainer sandbox used for XR compositing. ↪

These keys are available in addition to keys provided by the most recent call to TrustTokenKeyCommitments::Set. For issuers with keys provided through both the command line and TrustTokenKeyCommitments::Set, the keys provided through the command line take precedence. This is because someone testing manually might want to pass additional keys via the command line to a real Chrome release with the component updater enabled, and it would be surprising if the manually-passed keys were overwritten some time after startup when the component updater runs. ↪

--host-package-name[10] ⊗	When we retrieve the package name within the SDK Runtime, we need to use a bit of a hack to do this by taking advantage of the fact that the pid is the same pid as the application's pid + 10000. see: https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/main/+/main:frameworks/base/core/java/android/os/Process.java;l=292;drc=47fffdd53115a9af1820e3f89d8108745be4b55d When the render process is created however, it is just a regular isolated process with no particular association so we can't perform the same hack. When creating minidumps, the package name is retrieved from the process meaning the render process minidumps would end up reporting a generic process name not associated with the app. We work around this by feeding through the host package information to the render process when launching it. ↪

This switch has no effect unless --user-data-dir (as defined by the content embedder) is also present. ↪
--ignore-google-port-numbers ⊗	When set, this will ignore the PortPermission passed in the google_util.h methods and ignore the port numbers. This makes it easier to run tests for features that use these methods (directly or indirectly) with the EmbeddedTestServer, which is more representative of production. ↪
--ignore-gpu-blocklist ⊗	Ignores GPU blocklist. ↪
--ignore-profile-directory-if-not-exists ⊗	If provided with kProfileDirectory, does not create the profile if the profile directory doesn't exist. ↪

Takes a JSON dict, with each key being an origin (RFC 6454 Section 6.2) and each value a comma-separated list of client hint tokens (RFC 8942 Section 3.1, client-hints-infrastructure Section 7.1). Each origin/token-list entry will be parsed and persisted to the Client Hints storage as though the token-list had come through an Accept-CH response header from a navigation from the origin. The initialization will only apply to non-OffTheRecord profiles, meaning incognito or guest profiles will not have the storage applied. ↪
--input ⊗	No description ↪
--inspector-protocol-log ⊗	Specifies the path to a file containing a Chrome DevTools protocol log. Each line in the log file is expected to be a protocol message in the JSON format. The test runner will use this log file to script the backend for any inspector-protocol tests that run. Usually you would want to run a single test using the log to reproduce timeouts or crashes. ↪

--lacros-chrome-additional-args ⊗	If this switch is set, then ash-chrome will pass additional arguments when launching lacros-chrome. The string '####' is used as a delimiter. Example: --lacros-chrome-additional-args="--foo=5####--bar=/tmp/dir name". Will result in two arguments passed to lacros-chrome: --foo=5 --bar=/tmp/dir name ↪

--lacros-mojo-socket-for-testing ⊗	If set, ash-chrome will drop a Unix domain socket to wait for a process to connect to it, and the connection will be used to request file descriptors from ash-chrome, and when the process forks to start a lacros-chrome, the obtained file descriptor will be used by lacros-chrome to set up the mojo connection with ash-chrome. There are mainly two use cases: 1. Test launcher to run browser tests in testing environment. 2. A terminal to start lacros-chrome with a debugger. ↪

--no-first-run ⊗	Skip First Run tasks, whether or not it's actually the First Run, and the What's New page. Overridden by kForceFirstRun (for FRE) and kForceWhatsNew (for What's New). This does not drop the First Run sentinel and thus doesn't prevent first run from occurring the next time chrome is launched without this flag. It also does not update the last What's New milestone, so does not prevent What's New from occurring the next time chrome is launched without this flag. ↪
--no-mojo ⊗	Disables Mojo initialization completely in the process. Only applies to test child processes. See base::MultiprocessTest. ↪

--no-startup-window ⊗	Does not automatically open a browser window on startup (used when launching Chrome for the purpose of hosting background apps). ↪
--no-subproc-heap-profiling ⊗	Forces Heap Profiling off for a subprocess. The browser will add this when the kHeapProfilerCentralControl feature is enabled but the subprocess should not be profiled. TODO(https://crbug.com/40840943): This is the default behaviour so the switch only exists to validate that HeapProfilerController adds a switch to every child process that's launched. Remove it once that's verified. ↪
--no-system-proxy-config-service ⊗	Do not use system proxy configuration service. ↪
--no-unsandboxed-zygote ⊗	Disables the unsandboxed zygote. Note: this flag should not be used on most platforms. It is introduced because some platforms (e.g. Cast) have very limited memory and binaries won't be updated when the browser process is running. ↪

Any other value will lead to Chrome detecting the best backend automatically. TODO(crbug.com/40449930): Once PasswordStore no longer uses KWallet for storing passwords, rename this flag to stop referencing passwords. Do not rename it sooner, though; developers and testers might rely on it keeping large amounts of testing passwords out of their KWallets. ↪

--prevent-resizing-contents-for-testing[32] ⊗	For mobile devices, tests should include a viewport meta tag to specify page dimension adjustments. Omitting the tag can lead to automatic resizing to the standard mobile fallback size (980), which results in content shrinking as it first expands to 980, then scales down to 800 to fit the screen, as observed in the issue at https://crrev.com/c/4615623. This flag is intended for use in tests that do not include a viewport meta tag. When enabled, it ensures the viewport size matches the standard mobile fallback size, thereby helping to prevent content resizing in such tests. ↪

More details here: - https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/process-models - The class comment in site_instance.h, listing the supported process models. IMPORTANT: This isn't to be confused with --site-per-process (which is about isolation, not consolidation). You probably want the other one. ↪
--process-per-tab ⊗	Runs each set of script-connected tabs (i.e., a BrowsingInstance) in its own renderer process. We default to using a renderer process for each site instance (i.e., group of pages from the same registered domain with script connections to each other). TODO(creis): This flag is currently a no-op. We should refactor it to avoid "unnecessary" process swaps for cross-site navigations but still swap when needed for security (e.g., isolated origins). ↪

--profiling-file ⊗	Specifies a location for profiling output. This will only work if chrome has been built with the gyp variable profiling=1 or gn arg enable_profiling=true. {pid} if present will be replaced by the pid of the process. {count} if present will be incremented each time a profile is generated for this process. The default is chrome-profile-{pid} for the browser and test-profile-{pid} for tests. ↪
--profiling-flush ⊗	Controls whether profile data is periodically flushed to a file. Normally the data gets written on exit but cases exist where chromium doesn't exit cleanly (especially when using single-process). A time in seconds can be specified. ↪

--pull-to-refresh ⊗	Enables or disables pull-to-refresh gesture in response to vertical overscroll. Set the value to '0' to disable the feature, set to '1' to enable it for both touchpad and touchscreen, and set to '2' to enable it only for touchscreen. Defaults to disabled. ↪
--purge-model-and-features-store ⊗	Purges the store containing prediction medels and host model features on startup, so that it's guaranteed to be using fresh data. ↪
--purge-optimization-guide-store ⊗	Purges the store containing fetched and component hints on startup, so that it's guaranteed to be using fresh data. ↪
--pwa-launcher-version[1] ⊗	Specifies the version of the Progressive-Web-App launcher that launched Chrome, used to determine whether to update all launchers. NOTE: changing this switch requires adding legacy handling for the previous method, as older PWA launchers still using this switch will rely on Chrome to update them to use the new method. ↪

--touch-events ⊗	Enable support for touch event feature detection. ↪
--touch-selection-strategy ⊗	Controls how text selection granularity changes when touch text selection handles are dragged. Should be "character" or "direction". If not specified, the platform default is used. ↪
--touch-slop-distance ⊗	Overrides touch slop distance for gesture detection. The touch slop distance is the maximum distance from the starting point of a touch sequence that a gesture can travel before it can no longer be considered a tap. Scroll gestures can only begin after this distance has been travelled. The switch value is a floating point number that is interpreted as a distance in pixels. ↪
--touchscreen-usable-while-screen-off ⊗	Chromebases' touchscreens can be used to wake from suspend, unlike the touchscreens on other Chrome OS devices. If set, the touchscreen is kept enabled while the screen is off so that it can be used to turn the screen back on after it has been turned off for inactivity but before the system has suspended. ↪
--touch_view ⊗	No description ↪
--tpm-is-dynamic ⊗	Enables TPM selection in runtime. ↪
--trace-config-file ⊗	Causes TRACE_EVENT flags to be recorded from startup. This flag will be ignored if --trace-startup or --trace-shutdown is provided. ↪
--trace-smb-size ⊗	Configures the size of the shared memory buffer used for tracing. Value is provided in kB. Defaults to 4096. Should be a multiple of the SMB page size (currently 32kB on Desktop or 4kB on Android). ↪
--trace-startup ⊗	Causes TRACE_EVENT flags to be recorded from startup. Optionally, can specify the specific trace categories to include (e.g. --trace-startup=base,net) otherwise, all events are recorded. Setting this flag results in the first call to BeginTracing() to receive all trace events since startup. Historically, --trace-startup was used for browser startup profiling and --enable-tracing was used for browsertest tracing. Now they are share the same implementation, but both are still supported to avoid disrupting existing workflows. The only difference between them is the default duration (5 seconds for trace-startup, unlimited for enable-tracing). If both are specified, 'trace-startup' takes precedence. In Chrome, you may find --trace-startup-file and --trace-startup-duration to control the auto-saving of the trace (not supported in the base-only TraceLog component). ↪
--trace-startup-duration ⊗	Sets the time in seconds until startup tracing ends. If omitted: - if --trace-startup is specified, a default of 5 seconds is used. - if --enable-tracing is specified, tracing lasts until the browser is closed. Has no effect otherwise. ↪
--trace-startup-file ⊗	If supplied, sets the file which startup tracing will be stored into, if omitted the default will be used "chrometrace.log" in the current directory. Has no effect unless --trace-startup is also supplied. Example: --trace-startup --trace-startup-file=/tmp/trace_event.log As a special case, can be set to 'none' - this disables automatically saving the result to a file and the first manually recorded trace will then receive all events since startup. ↪
--trace-startup-format ⊗	Sets the output format for the trace, valid values are "json" and "proto". If not set, the current default is "proto". "proto", unlike json, supports writing the trace into the output file incrementally and is more likely to retain more data if the browser process unexpectedly terminates. Ignored if "trace-startup-owner" is not "controller". ↪
--trace-startup-owner ⊗	Specifies the coordinator of the startup tracing session. If the legacy tracing backend is used instead of perfetto, providing this flag is not necessary. Valid values: 'controller', 'devtools', or 'system'. Defaults to 'controller'. If 'controller' is specified, the session is controlled and stopped via the TracingController (e.g. to implement the timeout). If 'devtools' is specified, the startup tracing session will be owned by DevTools and thus can be controlled (i.e. stopped) via the DevTools Tracing domain on the first session connected to the browser endpoint. If 'system' is specified, the system Perfetto service should already be tracing on a supported platform (currently only Android). Session is stopped through the normal methods for stopping system traces. ↪
--trace-startup-record-mode ⊗	If supplied, sets the tracing record mode and options; otherwise, the default "record-until-full" mode will be used. ↪
--trace-to-console ⊗	Sends a pretty-printed version of tracing info to the console. ↪
--trace-to-file ⊗	Sends trace events from these categories to a file. --trace-to-file on its own sends to default categories. ↪
--trace-to-file-name ⊗	Specifies the file name for --trace-to-file. If unspecified, it will go to a default file name. ↪
--translate-ranker-model-url ⊗	Overrides the URL from which the translate ranker model is downloaded. ↪
--translate-script-url ⊗	Overrides the default server used for Google Translate. ↪
--translate-security-origin ⊗	Overrides security-origin with which Translate runs in an isolated world. ↪
--true ⊗	Value indicating whether flag from command line switch is true. ↪
--trusted-download-sources ⊗	Identifies a list of download sources as trusted, but only if proper group policy is set. ↪
--try-supported-channel-layouts[1] ⊗	Instead of always using the hardware channel layout, check if a driver supports the source channel layout. Avoids outputting empty channels and permits drivers to enable stereo to multichannel expansion. Kept behind a flag since some drivers lie about supported layouts and hang when used. See http://crbug.com/259165 for more details. ↪

--use-cast-browser-pref-config ⊗	Rather than share a common pref config file with cast_service, use a dedicated browser pref config file. This must be set when `cast_browser` is running in a different process from `cast_service`. ↪
--use-cmd-decoder ⊗	Use the Pass-through command decoder, skipping all validation and state tracking. Switch lives in ui/gl because it affects the GL binding initialization on platforms that would otherwise not default to using EGL bindings. ↪

--use-fake-ui-for-media-stream ⊗	Bypass the media stream infobar by selecting the default device for media streams (e.g. WebRTC). Works with --use-fake-device-for-media-stream. Prefer --auto-accept-camera-and-microphone-capture which does not interact with screen/tab capture. ↪
--use-file-for-fake-audio-capture ⊗	Play a .wav file as the microphone. Note that for WebRTC calls we'll treat the bits as if they came from the microphone, which means you should disable audio processing (lest your audio file will play back distorted). The input file is converted to suit Chrome's audio buses if necessary, so most sane .wav files should work. You can pass either <path> to play the file looping or <path>%noloop to stop after playing the file to completion. Must also be used with kDisableAudioInput or kUseFakeDeviceForMediaStream. ↪
