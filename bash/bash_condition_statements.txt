If Else and Case Statements
Ref: [https://linuxhandbook.com/if-else-bash/]

1. Using if statement
if [ condition ]; then
  your code
else
  your anothe code
fi

Pay attention to white space!
There must be a space between the opening and closing brackets and the
condition you write. Otherwise, the shell will complain of error.
There must be space before and after the conditional operator (=, ==, <= etc).
Otherwise, you'll see an error like "unary operator expected".

2. Using Case statement
case "variable" in
  "pattern1" )
    Command … ;;
  "pattern2" )
    Command … ;;
  "pattern2" )
    Command … ;;
esac

Pay attention!
The patterns are always followed by a blank space and ).
Commands are always followed by double semicolon ;;. White space is not
mandatory before it.
Case statements end with esac (reverse of case).

3. Bash if else statement in one line
if [ $(whoami) = 'root' ]; then echo "root"; else echo "not root"; fi
